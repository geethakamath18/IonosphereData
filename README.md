# IonosphereData
Regression with Least Squares loss, Hinge loss and Logistic Loss on the Ionosphere data with CVX package
This is a binary classification problem where the outcome is either 'good' or 'bad' depending on various attributes.
The dataset can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ionosphere
I performed regression on the data with the following loss functions and achieved the following results:
1. Hinge Loss:  Achieved accuracy of 97%
2. Logistic Loss: Achieved accuracy of 96%
3. Least Squares Loss:  Achieved accuracy of 94%
